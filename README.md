# 🏦 ATM Machine Simulator

A console-based ATM machine simulator built in Java that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts and real-world banking operations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates a complete ATM banking system with user authentication, transaction processing, and account management. Built using pure Java with a command-line interface, it showcases professional coding practices and OOP design principles.

## ✨ Key Features

- **User Authentication** - PIN-based login with security validation
- **Banking Operations** - Balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit
- **Account Management** - PIN change functionality with security checks
- **Transaction History** - Complete transaction logging and mini statements
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- **Professional Interface** - Clean CLI design with user-friendly prompts

## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation** - Private fields with controlled access through getters/setters
- **Inheritance** - Extensible class design for different account types
- **Polymorphism** - Method overloading and flexible object behavior
- **Abstraction** - Clean interfaces hiding implementation complexity
- **Composition** - Customer-Account relationship modeling
- **Singleton Pattern** - Bank class ensuring single instance
- **Immutable Objects** - Transaction records maintaining data integrity

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Account.java** - Core account operations and balance management
- **Transaction.java** - Immutable transaction record system
- **Customer.java** - Customer entity with account relationships
- **Bank.java** - Central banking service with sample data
- **ATMSimulator.java** - Main application with CLI interface
